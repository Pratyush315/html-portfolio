    My father is a Businessman , whereas my mother is a housewife.
    A lot of caring moments and love is always what I get from everyone

    which always led me to be motivated toward the future.

    All my virtues have been incorporated into me by my college
    and helping is one of them. My college always aim at the holistic
    development of a student and it focuses on the fact that we develop
    both morally as well as academially. It is always a part of learning 
    that you try to inculcate virtues in yourself by being an honest person.
    To be resposible and to adhere to your duties, is what our college 
    teaches us.

    I am very consistent and punctual in my class. I always try to improve
    my skills and morals to become a better student. I do this by helping
    my clasmates with love and dedication.

    I love to study storybooks as a pastime and football is my favourite sport.
    I believe one should practice a lot of sports to keep oneself healthy to get 
    focused.

    I love to participate in various curricular activities at my college. I have 
    a huge interest in sports and have bagged many awards and honours for my school.
    I am always thankful to my family and my friends for making me so humble and 
    helping me everyday by trying to show me the goal in the bunch of cloudy weather.

      LIfe is a jar of both happiness as well as sadness. Getting always what we want 
      , is not the nature of life. Thus, needs to keep oneself always motivated to 
      the highest level. Follow the footprints of the great men to never be discouraged
      and keep yourself focused on your goal.
